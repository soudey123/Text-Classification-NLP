# NLP-text-classification-model


Unstructured data in the form of text: chats, emails, social media, survey responses is present everywhere today. Text can be a rich source of information, but due to its unstructured nature it can be hard to extract insights from it.
Text classification is one of the important task in supervised machine learning (ML). It is a process of assigning tags/categories to documents helping us to automatically & quickly structure and analyze text in a cost-effective manner. It is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing with broad applications such as sentiment-analysis, spam-detection, topic-labeling, intent-detection etc.

**NOTE**
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that have been puposed for building NLP classification models based on following logis:

1. Build NLP model using tf-idf technique in order to perform binary classification (Disaster and non-disaster tweets.)
2. Build NLP model using tf-idf and word2vec techniques in order to perform multiple classification on COVID-19 tweets. 

**Letâ€™s divide the classification problem into the below steps:**

1. Setup: Importing Libraries
2. Loading the data set & Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Text pre-processing
4. Extracting vectors from text (Vectorization)
5. Running Logistic Regerssion algorithm on vectirized data
6. Validate model on test dataset
